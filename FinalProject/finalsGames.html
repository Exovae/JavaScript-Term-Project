        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <div class="dropdown-description">
            <p>Memory Match: A classic memory matching game where players have to match pairs of images hidden behind cards. 
                When players click on two cards, they flip over, revealing the images behind them. If the images match, the cards remain face-up, 
                and players can move on to the next pair. If they don't match, the cards flip back over, and players have to try again. 
                The game ends when all the cards are matched.

            <p>Hangman: Players have to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Players start with a certain number of lives, and for each incorrect guess, 
                a part of the hangman's body is drawn. If players use up all their lives before guessing the word, the game is over. 
                You can also add a feature to allow players to choose a category, such as "animals" or "movies," to make the game more interesting.</p>

          <div class="dropdown-description">
            <p>Simon: A simple game where players have to repeat a sequence of colored buttons in the same order. 
                The game starts with a simple sequence of two colors, and each time the player succeeds, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. 
                If the player makes a mistake, the game ends. You can also add a feature to keep track of the player's high score, so they can try to beat their previous record.</p>
