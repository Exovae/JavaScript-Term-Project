Memory Match Game

Purpose:
The purpose of this game is to match pairs of cards with the same image. The game is designed to improve memory and concentration skills, and is suitable for players of all ages.

How to Play:
To play the game, click on a card to reveal its image. Then, click on another card to reveal its image. If the two cards match, they will stay face-up. If they don't match, they will flip back over, and you will have to try again. The game ends when all the cards are matched.

Current Problems or Issues:
    Occasionally, some cards may be placed in the same position, making them impossible to match.

    The game does not currently keep track of the player's time or score.

Plans to Resolve the Problems or Issues:
    I plan to implement a feature that will prevent identical cards from being placed in the same position.

    I plan to add a timer and a score counter to the game to make it more challenging.

Plans for Future Releases:
    I plan to add more levels with increasing difficulty, such as more cards and less time to complete the game.

    I plan to add sound effects and animations to make the game more engaging.

    I plan to add a leaderboard where players can compete against each other for the highest score.
