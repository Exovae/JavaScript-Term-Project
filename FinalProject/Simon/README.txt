README.TXT - Simon Game

Purpose:
The purpose of the Simon game is to test the player's memory and ability to follow a sequence of colors and sounds. The game involves a series of rounds, each with an increasingly complex sequence.

Directions:

Start the game by pressing the "Start" button.
Simon will light up one of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, or yellow) and emit a tone.
The player must press the corresponding button to match the sequence.
Simon will then repeat the sequence with the previous color added and the player must repeat the entire sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order.
The game continues with increasingly complex sequences until the player makes a mistake and loses the game.
